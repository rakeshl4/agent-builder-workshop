🇭🇷 Croatia - similar coastal trails, 30% cheaper. Want details?
```

How about Croatia? Similar vibes, great trails, budget-friendly!
```

**Teaching Point:** This demonstrates the WOW factor - persistent memory across sessions!

```

**Without Memory - Agent Response:**

## Common Failure Patterns (Quick Reference)

### ❌ Without Profile Memory
- **Repetitive Questions** - Asks same questions every conversation
- **Generic Recommendations** - No personalization or context
- **No Learning** - Doesn't improve with more interactions
- **Poor UX** - User must repeat themselves constantly
- **No Cross-Session Memory** - Every conversation starts from zero

### ✅ With Profile Memory
- **Progressive Learning** - Builds profile incrementally
- **Personalized Suggestions** - Tailored to user preferences
- **Contextual Responses** - References past trips and preferences
- **Persistent Memory** - Remembers across sessions
- **Trust Building** - Can recall what it knows about user
